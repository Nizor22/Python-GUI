# Simple scripts

This repository withholds all the scripts I had written while 
I was learning about GUI programming on Python. These are simple
scripts I had written only to implement and practice the knowledge 
I gained from YouTube Course by SkillShare. Also, the repository withholds a major project on which I worked for the past two weeks, 
which is the PupilPath++.
